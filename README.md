## Training
The values of hyperparameters can be determined based on specific circumstances. For optimal parameters related to experimental results, please refer to the readme file in 'reproduction' folder.

```shell script
python main.py \
--data_name data_name \
--hidden_size 128 \
--num_hidden_layers 2 \
--hidden_dropout_prob 0.5 \
--attribute_hidden_size 128 \
--lr 0.0001
